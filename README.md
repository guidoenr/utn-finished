# UTN Finished
This repo contains all the data from all the assignements that i've done.

Please, be aware that this repo should be private, because is only information useful for my, but i leave it as public because sometimes my teammates need information from here.

- There is also a `optimize.py` script that generates the structures, format the images and clean up this repo with useless things.



# Optimize
```go
┌──(user㉿linux)-[~/utn-finished]
└─$ python3 optimize.py #(no external libraries required)
```
> Enjoy!
