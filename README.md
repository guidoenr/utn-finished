# utn-finished
this contains all the data from all the assignements that i've finished.

this repo should be private, because is only information useful for mine, but leaving it as public because some mates grab info from here sometimes.


- there is a `optimize.py` script that generates the structures, format the images and clean up this repo with useless things to keep it lightweight.

# optimize the repo
> no external libs required.
```go
┌──(user㉿linux)-[~/utn-finished]
└─$ python3 optimize.py
```
> Enjoy!
